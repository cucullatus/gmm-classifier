Gaussian Mixture Model for Classification

Run as:

> python classifier.py

The result file 'result.txt' will be generated under folder "./result"
This program requires the python library 'numpy' installed on your computer.

1. When you run the program, it will output some information on the screen, you can see the parameters changing in detail, or just ignore it.

2. I've already generate 'result.txt' for <test.txt>, it stays under folder './result'.

3. Note that I randomly pick <centroids> in the initialization step, so the result for each runing time may be a little different. The current 'result.txt' is generated when the accuarcy for <dev.txt> is 97.75%.
